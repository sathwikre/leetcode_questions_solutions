💻 LeetCode Solutions — My Daily Problem-Solving Practice Repository

💡 The Inspiration

“Practice daily.”
“Solve more problems.”
“Consistency matters.”

As a Computer Science student, I regularly practice Data Structures and Algorithms on LeetCode to improve my problem-solving skills.

What used to happen earlier was:

Solving problems on the platform

Code getting lost after submission

No proper way to track progress

Difficult to revisit solutions later


To avoid this, I started saving every solved problem in a GitHub repository.

This repository acts as my personal archive of LeetCode solutions.
